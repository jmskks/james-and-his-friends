"I am currently changing and modifying all the codes that I made two years ago. The codes will look better with more efficiency.
If you would like to see my new codes, please check my another branch and you should be able to see it! (It has not been done yet, though)
If you want to play the game, run "RUN.bat" file in master branch!
Thank you very much!"








Hello,
This is a text-based game that I built on my own in August 2018 after I took my Java I at community college in Spring 2018.
One thing I want to point out about this game is that the conversation between characters in the game is Korean, but it can still
be played without understanding the conversation. It is, however, required to understand the conversation to be enjoyable.
As you might have found in the code, the code is not perfect as I was a beginner Java programmer at the time I build this game. However,
through this experience I learned not only the basics of programming and also learned to think in seller's point of view for customers.
For example, when I was making the game, I kept thinking about what features I should add to make the game more enjoyable
for my friends.
These are the lists of the interesting that I implemented in the game:


A key feature where the actions of a user were dependent on probability, for example:
i) Flipping a coin at the beginning of a fight to decide who attacks first between a user and a group of enemies
ii) Attacking an enemy, escaping a fight, or blocking an enemy’s attack
iii) Occurrence of a critical attack by user characters or enemies
iv) When a character levels up, a user gets to roll a dice. If the result is the same number as a number I have set,
the user gets an extra point to increase the character’s attribute.


Saving and loading the game


Stories in Korean language of how I met my friends


Used informal words in Korean for fun
As this game was intended only for my friends in the first place, I sometimes used informal words and make fun of them to make
the game more enjoyable for them. For example, when they try to escape a fight, I go "You're so chickend out! Haha"


I set up the game however I want
At the final boss fight, I set the HP of the final boss absurdly high enough a user can never be able to beat on his own.
So I ask a user in the fight "Do you need help?". If the user says Yes, I nicely lower the HP of the final boss.
If the user says No, I leave a sarcastic comment to the user saying that "Good luck, then". The user probably have to reload the game
for my help :)


After finishing building the game, I distributed to my friends and they loved it. It is a very important experience for me moving on
to the next step of Computer Science field.
I hope you have enjoyed reading this. Thank you very much for visiting my github!
